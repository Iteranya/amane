Stuff To Do:

- Fix the RVC imports, get it ready, even though it's optional
- Make sure the kokoro library works (50/50 chance is not shippable)
- Add the text parser
- Add the data manager module 
- Prepare a space for training module (Planned Feature, but not priority yet)
- Prepare the main module, get it to work from Text Parser to Kokoro
- Test The Module (IMPORTANT DO NOT SKIP I SWEAR TO GOD DO NOT SKIP)
- Add the routes
- Add The Front End (With AI)
- Combine them all
- Haphazardly Add The RVC Feature When You Feel Like It 
- Test The Module (YES AGAIN, FROM THE START)
- Add the training module (Make it separate from the main ones)
- Profit???
